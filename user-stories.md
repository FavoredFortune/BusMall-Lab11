# User Stories: BusMall
*For Code Fellows 201 Bus Mall Project*

## Who are the users that would be engaging with this project?

### *User 1: Marketing research team*
As a marketing research team member, I want to get feedback from users so that I can determine which products to add to the BusMall catalog. I want this information to be displayed visually on the HTML page (when I want) and to tell me, for the total number of times an image was displayed, what % was that image clicked on. 

### *User 2: Developer*
As a developer I want to track the number of times an image is displayed, the number of clicks on and calculate the % of times an image is clicked on vs. when it is displayed, as well as display all this data visually in a readable, convienent way for the market research team and to reassure the focus group participant their votes have been tracked. I also want to make sure users see 25 sets of three random images and click a total of 25 times (no more no less). Lastly, I want to do this so that I can provide accurate data to the marketing research team as well as a visually appealing site for all users to interact with. 

### *User 3: Focus group participant*
As a focus group participant I want to see three images at a time so that I can select my favorite image and I want to know that my votes have been correctly tallied when I'm done.
