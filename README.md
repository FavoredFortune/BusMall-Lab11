# Bus Mall project
Code Fellows 201 Week 3 Project
*Helping Bus Mall of King County (fake) determine future products to carry*


## Why this project?

A few reasons:
* Learn more about planning and defining a problem domain
* Learn more about DOM, object literals and constructor functions
* Better understand how to DOM with JavaScript
* Help me practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS coding 
* It combines the three initial languages I'm learning as a developer: CSS, HTML, JavaScript

## Built with:

* VisualCode
* bash Linux terminal
* HTML
* md
* CSS  
* Erik Myer's CSS reset.css code
* JavaScript
* GitHub
* Jon Duckett HTML & CSS book
* Jon Duckett JavaScript & jQuery book
* Chart.js library found here: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.7.1/Chart.min.js
* For chart colors I used this table from W3Schools.com: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp and then converted the first 20 hex values into a concatenated string to insert into my color variable for the chart. This concatenation table may be found in my Google Sheets here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zdc0kBx3nAf9SgA8m5Pc7J4kkXhC3bwHgY7aCaghi2I/edit?usp=sharing
* Help from CodePen by Monty to display to values in my chart, located here: https://codepen.io/Shokeen/pen/NpgbKg?editors=0010#0
* Help from my instructor, classmates and TAs

## Use:

This is a practice project for me. This likely only has use if you are a student of HTML, CSS and Javascript and want to see examples of different code.
